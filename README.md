# Hello-World
New to the world of coding. In the midst of taking my first computer programming course.
I am currently attending McGill University, graduating in 2019. I was born and raised in China and moved to Canada when I was 8 years old. I am currently interested in learning iOS development, web development and android development. Hopeful to land an internship after my second year of university.
